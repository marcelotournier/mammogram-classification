# Computer Vision Project
### Predicting Mammogram results
- This is a didactic project to showcase some basic principles in Computer Vision and image pre-processing
- We are using images from the *Mini-MIAS database of mammograms* 
- Objective: Build the simplest and most effective classificator of mammograms, without using a neural network approach
- Classification outcomes: mammogram results as normal, benign, or malignant
