### Computer Vision Project - Predicting Mammogram results
- This is a didactic project to showcase some basic principles in Computer Vision and image pre-processing
- We are using images from the *Mini-MIAS database of mammograms* 
- Objective: Build the simplest and most effective classificator of mammograms, without using a neural network approach
